# Zephyr Examples

Some examples of using the Zephyr rust SDK to build programs. On this repository there are also versions
of Zephyr older than the one we're running now (still compatible, but the SDK is much less user-friendly). We recommend
checking out only

- [Zephyr Starter](./zephyr-starter/)
- [Zephyr Hello Ledger](./zephyr-hello-ledger/)
- [Soroban governor indexer](https://github.com/script3/soroban-governor-indexer): this is a real-world example that uses the newer SDK versions.
- [Zephyr Discord Bot](./zephyr-discord-bot/)
- [Zephyr Web Request](./zephyr-alert/)
- [Zephyr Logger](./zephyr-logger/)
